# Terms of Service — Lejne

_Last updated: 2025-09-23_

These Terms govern your use of the Lejne application (“Service”). By using Lejne, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. The Service
Lejne provides recordkeeping tools for building committees and residents, including dues calculation, receipts, invoices, and reports. Lejne is **not** a party to payment obligations between residents and the committee.

## 2. Accounts & Roles
Admins invite and approve members. Roles (admin/resident/auditor) and visibility settings are controlled by the building’s admins. By joining a building, you acknowledge that your data may be visible to other members according to those settings.

## 3. Payments
The Service supports cash-first workflows and may support online payments in the future. Lejne is not responsible for the fulfillment of any payment obligations among members or with suppliers.

## 4. Immutable Records
Financial records, invoices, receipts, and audit logs are **immutable**. Corrections are recorded via **append-only** entries linked to originals. No deletions/overwrites are allowed.

## 5. Content Responsibility
Admins are responsible for the accuracy of records they submit (payments, invoices, charges). Lejne does not arbitrate disputes between members; it provides transparent records for the committee to resolve.

## 6. Subscription & Referrals
Building subscriptions follow the pricing shared in-app. Referral credits extend subscription periods and are non-cash. Lejne may update pricing with notice.

## 7. Data & Privacy
Use is subject to the Privacy Policy. You represent that you have authority to upload invoices and building records and to share them with building members.

## 8. Acceptable Use
No unlawful content, no attempts to bypass security, no scraping or reverse engineering.

## 9. Termination
We may suspend or terminate access for violations. Building records may be retained for legal/audit purposes.

## 10. Disclaimers & Liability
The Service is provided “as is.” We disclaim all warranties to the maximum extent permitted by law. Liability is limited to the amount paid for the Service in the preceding 12 months.

## 11. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of Lebanon, without regard to conflict of laws.
